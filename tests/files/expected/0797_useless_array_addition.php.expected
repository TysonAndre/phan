%s:5 PhanUselessBinaryAddRight Addition of array{0:mixed} + array{0:float|int} ($arr += [($var + 1)]) is probably unnecessary. Array fields from the left hand side will be used instead of each of the fields from the right hand side
%s:10 PhanUselessBinaryAddRight Addition of array{0:mixed} + array{0:float|int} ($arr + [($var + 1)]) is probably unnecessary. Array fields from the left hand side will be used instead of each of the fields from the right hand side
%s:13 PhanUselessBinaryAddRight Addition of array{0:mixed} + list<mixed> ([$var] + $args) is probably unnecessary. Array fields from the left hand side will be used instead of each of the fields from the right hand side
%s:14 PhanSuspiciousBinaryAddLists Addition of list<mixed> + array{0:mixed} ($args + [$var]) is a suspicious way to add two lists. Some of the array fields from the left hand side will be part of the result, replacing the fields with the same key from the right hand side (this operator does not concatenate the lists)
%s:15 PhanSuspiciousBinaryAddLists Addition of list<int>|list<mixed> + list<mixed> (array_merge($args, [2]) + $args) is a suspicious way to add two lists. Some of the array fields from the left hand side will be part of the result, replacing the fields with the same key from the right hand side (this operator does not concatenate the lists)
%s:16 PhanSuspiciousBinaryAddLists Addition of list<mixed> + list<mixed> (array_reverse($args) + $args) is a suspicious way to add two lists. Some of the array fields from the left hand side will be part of the result, replacing the fields with the same key from the right hand side (this operator does not concatenate the lists)
%s:22 PhanUselessBinaryAddRight Addition of array{timeout:2,other:string} + array{timeout:1} ($fields += DEFAULTS797) is probably unnecessary. Array fields from the left hand side will be used instead of each of the fields from the right hand side
