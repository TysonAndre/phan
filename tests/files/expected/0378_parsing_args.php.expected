%s:4 PhanUnextractableAnnotationElementName Saw possibly unextractable annotation for a fragment of comment '* @param float[]string $blah this should be parsed as (at)param float[] - The following token `string` is nonsense.': after float[], did not see an element name (will guess based on comment order)

%s:10 PhanTypeMismatchArgumentProbablyReal Argument 1 ($x) is new stdClass() of type \stdClass but \test378() takes float[] (no real type) defined at %s:7 (the inferred real argument type has nothing in common with the parameter's phpdoc type)
%s:10 PhanTypeMismatchArgumentProbablyReal Argument 2 ($y) is new stdClass() of type \stdClass but \test378() takes int[] (no real type) defined at %s:7 (the inferred real argument type has nothing in common with the parameter's phpdoc type)
