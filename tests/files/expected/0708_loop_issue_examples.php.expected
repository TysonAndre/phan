%s:9 PhanCoalescingAlwaysNullInLoop Using $x of type null as the left hand side of a null coalescing (??) operation. The left hand side may be unnecessary. (in a loop body - this is likely a false positive)
%s:12 PhanCoalescingNeverNull Using non-null (unknown) of type Closure():'never called' as the left hand side of a null coalescing (??) operation. The right hand side may be unnecessary.

%s:18 PhanImpossibleConditionInLoop Impossible attempt to cast $x of type null to truthy in a loop body (may be a false positive)

%s:31 PhanImpossibleTypeComparisonInGlobalScope Impossible attempt to check if $zeroInGlobalScope of type 0 is identical to $nullVarInGlobalScope of type null in the global scope (likely a false positive)
%s:32 PhanCoalescingNeverNull Using non-null __LINE__ of type 32 as the left hand side of a null coalescing (??) operation. The right hand side may be unnecessary.
